# QR Code Component Challenge

### Overview

This is a beginner-level challenge where the goal is to create a QR Code component. The task involved designing a card element centered within the viewport using HTML and CSS, with basic responsiveness ensured by maintaining proper centering across different screen sizes.

### Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3 (plain CSS, no frameworks or libraries)
- Vite (for bundling the website)

### What I Learned

- The main challenge in this project was staying engaged as the task felt repetitive and lacked interactivity.
- I experimented with Vite to bundle the website, although it wasnâ€™t necessary for this project. It was a good experience to see how Vite manages bundling.

### Acknowledgments

- Used MDN documentation to refresh my memory on how to use custom CSS variables, but no tutorials were referenced.
